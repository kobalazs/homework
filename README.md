## Original specification

Hacker News is an excellent resource for front end engineers, but it looks quite ugly - have a look here: https://news.ycombinator.com/ .

Luckily, there is an Official Hacker News API (https://github.com/HackerNews/API) that we can use to create a better version. Using vue, react, or angular utilize the Hacker News API to create a web application that shows the latest stories. This project does not require you to implement a user profile page or comments just redesign the front page of hacker news.

What weâ€™re looking for:
* Readable and DRY code
* A clean, easy to use UI
* Use of best practices in you framework (vue, react, or angular)
* We value test coverage

Aside from what is outlined above, you have free reign in any design decisions and implementation details. You are free to use any version of angular or react and any CSS preprocessors. Plain CSS is okay, too!

Send the code in a password protected zip or via dropbox to us and state any assumptions that you made.
